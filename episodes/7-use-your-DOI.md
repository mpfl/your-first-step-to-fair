Once you have a DOI in your dataset, you can now include it in your manuscript's Data Availability Statement. If you're not sure what to write, consider formatting it like a citation:

> The datasets generated during and/or analysed during the current study are available from Zenodo as Liffers, Matthias. (2020). Residential photovoltaic system output in Western Australia [Data set]. [http://doi.org/10.5072/zenodo.678604]
