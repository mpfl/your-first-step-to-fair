During this workshop, we will be using an example dataset of [daily output observations from a residential solar PV system for 2019](pv-output.csv).

## Activity

Take the time to inspect the dataset. Despite the best intentions of the data creator, it might not be entirely self-explanatory.

* Is it easy to understand?
* What improvements could the creator undertake to make the data easier to understand?
* Is there anything about this dataset that could be considered sensitive?
