You have just taken your *first* step to FAIR. As previously discussed, "FAIRness" of data is a continuum and there are many opportunities to go beyond the basics.

The ARDC FAIR data self-assessment tool can highlight how you can make your data even more FAIR.

## Activity

Use the [ARDC FAIR data self-assessment tool](https://ardc.edu.au/resources/working-with-data/fair-data/fair-self-assessment-tool/) to assess the dataset you just uploaded to Zenodo. What improvements can you make to make your data even more FAIR?
