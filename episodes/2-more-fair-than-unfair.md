If you go through the FAIR guiding principles in detail, it can get overwhelming. Getting your data to a state of FAIR transendence involves a lot of
planning and work.

The FAIRness of a research object is on a continuum. Even taking a few small steps to FAIRifying your data will make a difference to the usefulness of that data, for both yourself and others.

## How do you start making data FAIR?

Ensure your data is *well-structured* and in an *open format*, then deposit it into a *reliable* repository with *good metadata* and apply an
*open licence*.

This might sound simple, but undertaking this activity can involve a lot of decisions and more prepatory work than you might expect.
